## Paper Submission Guidelines

We invite you to submit original research papers for presentation at the **IMEKO TC4 Conference 2026 with Special TC11 Technical Session**.

### Submission type

The IMEKO TC4 2026 Conference welcomes two categories of contributions. Authors are invited to choose the format that best suits the maturity and scope of their work.

#### Extended Abstract (1 page, not included in Proceedings)

This category is intended for researchers who wish to present ongoing work, preliminary results, or ideas that are not yet ready for full-paper publication or will be published later.

The length of the paper is exactly one page.

Extended abstracts will **not be included** in the official Conference Proceedings.

Extended abstracts **cannot be considered for invitation** to journal Special Issue.

Accepted abstracts will be presented as oral or poster contributions during the Conference, depending on the decision of the Technical Program Committee.

This format offers authors an opportunity to share ideas, gain feedback, and engage with the community without committing to a full manuscript.

#### Full Paper (4–6 pages, included in Proceedings)

Full papers should present original research, significant technical developments, or innovative applications relevant to the TC4 or TC11 community.

Manuscripts **must be 4–6 pages** in length and follow the provided formatting guidelines.

Full papers will undergo peer review by the Technical Program Committee.

Accepted full papers will be published in the official Conference Proceedings.

Selected high-quality papers will be invited for extended publication in a Special Issue of selected peer-reviewed journals (ACTA IMEO, Measurement journal).

This category is suitable for mature research results intended for archival publication and further dissemination within the IMEKO community.
